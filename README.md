A very rudimentary Google Chrome extension to keep a chunk of text handy, usually for copy/pasting.

TO DO:

	add tabs for multiple chunks of text under one button (rather than having to install multiple instances)
	keyboard shortcuts
	pasting without formatting automatically
	enable select-all with single click anywhere in box
