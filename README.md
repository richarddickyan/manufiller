A very rudimentary Google Chrome extension to keep a chunk of text handy, usually for copy/pasting.

TO INSTALL:
	
	Download 'template' folder and put anywhere on your computer. Edit the 'popup.html' file with the text you want to keep handy. Go to Chrome Extensions (>Settings >More Tools >Extensions) and check 'Developer mode'. Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and install your 'template' folder. Button should appear next to your address bar and clicking it will bring up a popup with your text.

TO DO:

	add tabs for multiple chunks of text under one button (rather than having to install multiple instances)
	keyboard shortcuts
	pasting without formatting automatically
	enable select-all with single click anywhere in box
	pack and allow download through google store
